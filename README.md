# ImmosquareYaml

ImmosquareYaml is a dedicated Ruby gem crafted to parse, dump and manage YML translation files with finesse.

In the past, there have been significant challenges in using existing YAML parsers like [Psych](https://github.com/ruby/psych) and [YAML](https://github.com/ruby/yaml) (which internally utilizes Psych). Issues arose, such as interpreting translation keys like `yes:`, `no:`, and others as booleans. Additionally, they showed shortcomings in effectively handling multiline texts, often faltering with notations like `key: |`, `key: |-`, `key: >`, `key: |5+`, `key: |3-`, and more.

## Why Choose ImmosquareYaml?

Here are some standout features and advantages of this gem:

- **Reserved Key Management**: Handles keys with "reserved" words seamlessly.

- **Complete Multiline Handling**: Efficiently processes multiline texts using various notations.

- **Value Uniformization**: Retains double quotes only when essential, ensuring a clean and readable output.

- **Emoji Handling**: Comprehensive management of emojis in YAML files.

- **Sorting Capability**: Offers sorting (enabled by default) during the cleaning or parsing phase for a structured representation.

- **Automatic Translations**: Features an automatic translation of YML files, leveraging the artificial intelligence of OpenAI.

- **Optimized for Translations**: Precisely tailored for handling translation files, addressing challenges faced with other parsers.

Whether you're managing translations, real estate data, or any other form of YML data, ImmosquareYaml offers a refined, efficient, and user-friendly experience. Dive in and simplify your YAML operations!

## Quick Example

Let's assume you have a YML file with some reserved keys, multiline texts, and emojis:

```YML
en:
  demo: "demo"
  yes: "This is not a boolean"
  no: "Neither is this"
  emoji: "Here's an emoji1: \U0001F600"
  emoji2: "Here's an emoji2 \U0001F600"
  demo2:
    demo2-1:
      demo2-1-1: "hello"
      demo2-1-2:
      demo2-1-3: "John Doe"
  demo3:
    1: "task #1"
    2: "task #2"
    3: "task #2"
  demo4:
    "1": "task #1"
    "2": "task #2"
    "3": "task #2"
  some_special_characters:
    special1: "-hyphen"
    special2: "*asterisk"
    special3: "%percent"
    special4: ",comma"
    special5: "!exclamation"
    special6: "?question_mark"
    special7: "&ampersand"
    special8: "#hash"
    special9: "@at"
  some_special_characters:
    special1: """-tiret"""
    special2: """*astÃ©risque"""
    special3: """%pourcent"""
    special4: """,virgule"""
    special5: """!point_d'exclamation"""
    special6: """?point_d'interrogation"""
    special7: """&esperluette"""
    special8: """#croisillon"""
    special9: """@arobase"""
  description1: "This is the first line of test #1 \U0001F600.\nThis is the second line of test#1.\nThis is the third line of test.#1"
  description2: |
    This is the first line of test #2 \U0001F600.
    This is the second line of test #2.
    This is the third line of test #2.
  description3: |4-
      This is the first line of test #3 \U0001F600.
      This is the second line of test #3.
      This is the third line of test #3.
  description4: >
    This is the first line of test #4 \U0001F600.
    This is the second line of test #4.
    This is the third line of test #4.
```

After processing this YML file, reserved keys such as yes and no are preserved, emojis are correctly interpreted, unnecessary quotes are removed, and multiline texts are formatted consistently.

```ruby
ImmosquareYaml.clean(path_to_file)
```

```YML
en:
  demo: demo
  demo2:
    demo2-1:
      demo2-1-1: hello
      demo2-1-2: null
      demo2-1-3: John Doe
  demo3:
    "1": "task #1"
    "2": "task #2"
    "3": "task #2"
  demo4:
    "1": "task #1"
    "2": "task #2"
    "3": "task #2"
  description1: |-
    This is the first line of test #1 ðŸ˜€.
    This is the second line of test#1.
    This is the third line of test.#1
  description2: |
    This is the first line of test #2 ðŸ˜€.
    This is the second line of test #2.
    This is the third line of test #2.
  description3: |4-
      This is the first line of test #3 ðŸ˜€.
      This is the second line of test #3.
      This is the third line of test #3.
  description4: |
    This is the first line of test #4 ðŸ˜€. This is the second line of test #4. This is the third line of test #4.
  emoji: "Here's an emoji1: ðŸ˜€"
  emoji2: Here's an emoji2 ðŸ˜€
  "no": Neither is this
  some_special_characters:
    special1: "-tiret"
    special2: "*astÃ©risque"
    special3: "%pourcent"
    special4: ",virgule"
    special5: "!point_d'exclamation"
    special6: "?point_d'interrogation"
    special7: "&esperluette"
    special8: "#croisillon"
    special9: "@arobase"
  "yes": This is not a boolean
```

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'immosquare-yaml'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
gem install immosquare-yaml
```

## Usage

### Parsing YAML Files

To convert a YAML file into a Ruby hash:

```ruby
hash = ImmosquareYaml.parse('path/to/your/file.yml')
```

By default, the resultant hash will be sorted. If you wish to prevent sorting:

```ruby
hash = ImmosquareYaml.parse('path/to/your/file.yml', :sort => false)
```

---

### Cleaning YAML Files

To sanitize a YAML file:

```ruby
ImmosquareYaml.clean('path/to/your/file.yml')
```

If you wish to prevent sorting after cleaning:

```ruby
ImmosquareYaml.clean('path/to/your/file.yml', :sort => false)
```

---

### Creating YAML Files

To create a YAML file from a Ruby hash:

```ruby
hash  = { 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2 }
lines = ImmosquareYaml.dump(hash)
File.write('path/to/your/file.yml', lines)
```

---

### Rake Tasks

For Rails users, there are two rake tasks provided to make YML file management simpler:

1. **Cleaning**: Cleans all translation files within your Rails application:

```bash
rake immosquare_yaml:clean
```
